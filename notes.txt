How Terraform, providers and modules work
Terraform provisions, updates, and destroys infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more.

Configurations are code written for Terraform, using the human-readable HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to describe the desired state of infrastructure resources.

Providers are the plugins that Terraform uses to manage those resources. Every supported service or infrastructure platform has a provider that defines which resources are available and performs API calls to manage those resources.

Modules are reusable Terraform configurations that can be called and configured by other configurations. Most modules manage a few closely related resources from a single provider.

The Terraform Registry makes it easy to use any provider or module. To use a provider or module from this registry, just add it to your configuration; when you run `terraform init`, Terraform will automatically download everything it needs.
